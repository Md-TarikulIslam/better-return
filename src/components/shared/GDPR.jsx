          ‍ 3. The Data Controller shall be responsible for ensuring that the

          1. The Data Processor shall solely be permitted to process personal
          data on documented instructions from the Data Controller unless
          processing is required under EU or Member State law to which the Data
          Processor is subject; in this case, the Data Processor shall inform
          the Data Controller of this legal requirement prior to processing
          unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of
          public interest, cf. Article 28, sub-section 3, para a. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 2. The Data Processor shall immediately inform the Data Controller
          if instructionsin the opinion of the Data Processor contravene the
          General Data Protection Regulation or data protection provisions
          contained in other EU or Member Statelaw. <br /> <br />‍
          <span className="font-bold">Confidentiality</span> <br /> <br />

          currently authorised to do so are able to access the personal data
          being processed on behalf of the Data Controller. Access to the data
          shall therefore without delay be denied if such authorisation is
          removed or expires. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 2. Only persons who require access to the personal data in order to
          fulfil the obligations of the Data Processor to the Data Controller
          shall be provided with authorisation. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 3. The Data Processor shall ensure that persons authorised to
          process personal data on behalf of the Data Controller have undertaken
          to observe confidentiality or are subject to suitable statutory
          obligation of confidentiality. <br /> <br />

          <br />
          ‍ 1. The Data Processor shall take all the measures required pursuant
          to Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation which
          stipulates that with consideration for the current level,
          implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purposes of
          processing and the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the
          rights and freedoms of natural persons, the Data Controller and
          Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
          measures to ensure a level of security appropriateto the risk. <br />{" "}
          <br />
          ‍ 2. The above obligation means that the Data Processor shall perform
          a risk assessment and there after implement measures to counter the
          identified risk. Depending on their relevance, the measures may
          include the following: <br /> <br />
          ‍ a. Pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data <br /> <br />
          b. The ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity,
          availability and resilience of processing systems and services. <br />{" "}

          effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring
          the security of the processing. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 3. The Data Processor shall inensuring the above – in all cases – at
          a minimum implement the level ofsecurity and the measures specified in
          Appendix C to this Data Processing Agreement. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 4. The Parties’ possibleregulation/agreement on remuneration etc.
          for the Data Controller’s or the Data Processor’s subsequent
          requirement for establishing additional security measures shall be
          specified in the Parties’ ‘Master Agreement’ or in Appendix Dto this
          Data Processing Agreement. <br /> <br />
          <span className="font-bold">Use of Sub-Processors</span> <br /> <br />
          1. The Data Processor shall meet the requirements specified in
          Article28, sub-section 2 and 4, of the General Data Protection
          Regulation in order toengage another processor (Sub-Processor). <br />{" "}
          <br />
          ‍ 2. The Data Processor shall therefore not engage another
          processor(Sub-Processor) for the fulfilment of this Data Processing
          Agreement withoutthe prior specific or general written consent of the
          Data Controller. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 3. In the event of general written consent, the Data Processor
          shallinform the Data Controller of any planned changes with regard to
          additions toor replacement of other data processors and thereby give
          the Data Controllerthe opportunity to object to such changes. <br />{" "}
          <br />
          ‍ 4. The Data Controller’srequirements for the Data Processor’s
          engagement of other sub-processors shallbe specified in Appendix B
          tothis Data Processing Agreement. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 5. The Data Controller’s consentto the engagement of specific
          sub-processors, if applicable, shall be specifiedin AppendixB tothis
          Data Processing Agreement. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 6. When the Data Processor has the Data Controller’s authorisation
          touse a sub-processor, the Data Processor shall ensure that the
          Sub-Processor issubject to the same data protection obligations as
          those specified in this DataProcessing Agreement on the basis of a
          contract or other legal document underEU law or the national law of
          the Member States, in particular providing thenecessary guarantees
          that the Sub-Processor will implement the appropriatetechnical and
          organisational measures in such a way that the processing meetsthe
          requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation. The Data
          Processor shall therefore be responsible – on the basis ofa
          sub-processor agreement – for requiring that the sub-processor at
          leastcomply with the obligations to which the Data Processor is
          subject pursuant tothe requirements of the General Data Protection
          Regulation and this DataProcessing Agreement and its associated
          Appendices. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 7. A copy of such a sub-processoragreement and subsequent amendments
          shall – at the Data Controller’s request –be submitted to the Data
          Controller who will thereby have the opportunity toensure that a valid
          agreement has been entered into between the Data Processorand the
          Sub-Processor. Commercial terms and conditions, such as pricing,
          thatdo not affect the legal data protection content of the
          sub-processor agreement,shall not require submission to the Data
          Controller. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 8. The Data Processor shall in hisagreement with the Sub-Processor
          include the Data Controller as a third partyin the event of the
          bankruptcy of the Data Processor to enable the DataController to
          assume the Data Processor’s rights and invoke these as regardsthe
          Sub-Processor, e.g. so that the Data Controller is able to instruct
          theSub-Processor to perform the erasure or return of data. <br />{" "}
          <br />
          9. If the Sub-Processor does not fulfil his data
          protectionobligations, the Data Processor shall remain fully liable to
          the DataController as regards the fulfilment of the obligations of
          theSub-Processor. <br /> <br />

          interest, cf. Article 28, sub-section 3, para a. <br /> <br />
          ‍ 2. Without the instructions or approval of the Data Controller, the

          Processing Agreement: <br /> <br />
          a. disclose personal data to adata controller in a third country or in
